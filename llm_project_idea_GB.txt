idea for LLM project

reads in CV
reads in job descriptions (either using direct url or just url from a company you are interested in)

It will summarise jobs that you could apply for and help you optimize your CV
    - it will say what is relevant from you CV and help you to update it
    - it will identify what you are missing from the job advert
